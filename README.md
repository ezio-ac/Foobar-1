# Foobar
Discovered by a Hacker news user in November 2014, the mysterious page was thought to be an obscure promotion for The Imitation Game, a film starring Benedict Cumberbatch as World War 2 code-breaker Alan Turing. The web address 146.148..62.204 still shows a page which looks similar to google.foobar - and to what Rosett encountered - but says "this code has been cracked" with the final word linking to The Imitation Game's website.

Called foo.bar, the system has been used by Google for the past few years and is triggered when a user enters certain search terms relating to coding languages like Python and Java. The search results page breaks open to reveal the message "You're speaking our language. Up for a challenge?" to which the user can decline once, request the message isn't shown again, or click "I want to play".
